# UX-UI-Design-Kiva Application

Project Two Guidelines

Kiva is very pleased with the way you have gotten to know their needs and customer base; now they are ready for you to take the next steps! They need you to create a digital wireframe for the Kiva borrower’s interface, explain your design decisions, and make a plan for development of a cloud-based system in service of Kiva’s lenders. Recall that Kiva crowdfunds loans and unlocked capital for the underserved, improving the quality and cost of financial services and addressing the underlying barriers to financial access around the world, so your understanding of work in this space is very valuable.
Previously, you explored Kiva’s Data Snapshots page and analyzed the data found in the Kiva Snapshots CSV file that was provided. This allowed you to start considering how you would address the following two user stories:
1. As a Kiva borrower, I want to access information about Kiva and about borrowing from Kiva with my flip-phone (which is an embedded device), so that I can stay informed, request loans, and track my loan payback process.
2. As a Kiva lender, I want to explore borrower requests, analyze my and others’ lending data, and follow borrower loan payments (in a cloud application) so that I can forecast how I will loan funds and plan the recycling of previous paid funds.
You will continually reference these user stories, along with the work you have already completed, as you develop the wireframe for the UI design of the embedded system and a plan to build the cloud application using UI and UX best practices.
